# It's hard remembering everything.

Have you ever forgotten someone's name even though you meet them in the corridor every single day? Ever forgotten someone's branch / degree because you're one diagnosis away from clinical Dementia? Or maybe you just want to stalk somebody on campus for the fun of it?

Don't worry, I've got you covered. No longer do you have to ask "Oh btw what's your name again?" to someone who you've been talking to on a regular basis for 1.5 months (Not based on personal experience of course).

Use this website to instantly find anyone you want in BITS Goa, based on their degree / id / hostel / room number / name.
It's that simple.
It's that easy.
Heck, you can even download the app from the website if you use it regularly, and want it to run offline.
